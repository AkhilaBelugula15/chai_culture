# Chai Culture — Local Run Instructions

This repo contains a simple static frontend and a minimal Express backend to serve product data and accept contact submissions.

Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ installed

Install and run

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Notes
- The backend is minimal and stores nothing; contact submissions are logged to the server console.
- To deploy, consider adding a persistent datastore and secure contact/email handling.
